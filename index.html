		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>Hi, I'm a 20 years old student who's really passionate about programming and especially game development. 
			Currently I'm attending Eötvös Loránd University where I study ICT. </p>
		<h2>Skills</h2>
		<p>My current skillset includes a lot of different technologies I've achieved over almost a decade of learning 
			and I'm eager to learn more things and get experience working on commercial projects.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3><i class="fa fa-wifi"></i> Web Development</h3>
		Known Languages:
		<ul>
			<li>HTML</li>
			<li>CSS/SCSS</li>
			<li>JS</li>
			<li>PHP</li>
			<li>NodeJS</li>
			<li>React</li>
			<li>Laravel</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			I was interested in web development for a long time, and eventually managed to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript on my own. 
			Later I've taken a lot of classes to further sharpen my skills.
		</p>
		<p>
			In my last semester I finished Client-side web development and Server-side web development courses, 
			where I've learned about and used React and Laravel.
		</p>
		<p>
			My thesis for university was a <a href="https://github.com/Luminighty/jelloscript" target="_blank">JavaScript Game Engine</a> made to be similar to Unity while using the strengths of JavaScript.
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h3><i class="fa fa-code"></i> Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
		Known Languages:
		<ul>
			<li>C#</li>
			<li>Java</li>
			<li>C++</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The first OOP language I've learned was C#. I've already known some Javascript at that point, however the 
			Unity Engine's support for C# was far better than for Javascript, so I've decided to pick it up. With it came most of my
			programming knowledge which I could apply to most other languages too.</p>
		<p>Java and C++ are the two main languages I'm using at University, however I did make some hobby projects with them already.
			Most notably is my Java Assignment game called <a href="https://github.com/Luminighty/dungeon-crawler" target="_blank">Dungeon Crawlers</a>. I could've picked small much easier projects such as snake, 
			but I really wanted to see how far I could get in a short amount of time. I'm really proud of how it turned out in the end!
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h3><i class="fa fa-terminal"></i> Scripting</h3>
		Known Languages:
		<ul>
			<li>LUA</li>
			<li>Python</li>
			<li>Rust</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I got interested in LUA because I've seen that a lot of Game Developer companies ask for (or atleast prefer to have) LUA knowledge. 
			At that time I wasn't sure why they would do that, so I picked it up, and realized that scripting languages are 
			really useful for fast/easy coding. Recently I've used it with the game engine LOVE2D
		</p>
		<p>
			I used Python a lot during the last few years at the University, and I still use it whenever 
			I need a quick script to do the tedious work for me. (For example renaming files)</p>
		<p>
			Rust was a really interesting experience to learn, however I've come to love it once I wrapped my head around it.
			I believe it will be a really powerful tool in the near future for any kind of software development. 
		</p>

		<h3><i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> Other</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>SQL</li>
			<li>Unity</li>
			<li>Photoshop</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I've learned SQL at the University last semester, while I'm self taught when it comes to Unity and Photoshop.</p>
